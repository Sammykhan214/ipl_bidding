# 🗓️ End of Day Summary - **11th July 2025**

> **Today's Goal:**  
🎯 Complete all player filtering APIs and integrate auction end logic (manual + automatic) in a clean, backend-independent manner.

---

## ✅ What Was Completed Today

### 🔍 1. Status-Based Player Filter APIs

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Status |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| `/api/players/sold` | `GET` | Fetch all SOLD players | ✅ |
| `/api/players/unsold` | `GET` | Fetch all UNSOLD players | ✅ |
| `/api/players/on-auction` | `GET` | Fetch players currently ON_AUCTION | ✅ |

---

### 🔁 2. Bonus: Query Parameter Based Filter

| Endpoint | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `/api/players?status=SOLD` | `GET` | Filters players by any `AuctionStatus` (UNSOLD, SOLD, ON_AUCTION) |
- Converted to `AuctionStatus.valueOf(...)` internally
- Handled invalid enum using try-catch and 400 error with empty list

---

### 🔚 3. `endAuction()` API (Manual Stop)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/auction/end` | `POST` | Manually stops the auction by setting `currentPlayerId = null` |

---

### ⚙️ 4. Auto-End Auction Logic

- Inside `placeBid()`:
    - After a player is marked SOLD
    - If **no UNSOLD players remain**, `currentPlayerId = null` is triggered
    - Auction ends automatically

---

### 🧠 5. Validation Enhancements

- Prevented re-bid on already SOLD player inside `placeBid()`:
```java
if (player.getStatus() == AuctionStatus.SOLD) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Player already sold.");
}
