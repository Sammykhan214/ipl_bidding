# 🗓️ End of Day Summary - **9th July 2025**

> **Today's Goal:**  
🎯 Complete the core admin auction control system including start, next, and current-player flow.

---

## ✅ What Was Completed Today

### 🔧 1. AuctionState System (Memory-Based)
- Created `AuctionState.java` to hold the current player being auctioned
- Annotated with `@Component` so Spring maintains a singleton instance

---

### 🛠️ 2. Admin Auction Control APIs

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Status |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| `/api/auction/start` | `POST` | Starts auction for player using `playerId` | ✅ |
| `/api/auction/current-player` | `GET` | Fetches currently auctioned player | ✅ |
| `/api/auction/next` | `POST` | Moves to next unsold player | ✅ |

---

### 💡 Logic Highlights

- Auction logic is **state-driven**, not dependent on bid input
- Introduced `AuctionService` for clean control logic
- Ensured validation for player existence and state updates
- Used **constructor injection** instead of `@Autowired` for clean code
- Separated code into folders: `controller`, `service`, `util`, `dto`, `entity`

## 🔁 Sample Request for `/api/auction/start`

```json
{
  "playerId": 1
}
