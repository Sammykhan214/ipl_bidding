# 🗓️ End of Day Summary - **10th July 2025**

> **Today's Goal:**  
🎯 Complete the `/reset` logic for restarting auction flow cleanly and ensure player status handling is consistent system-wide.

---

## ✅ What Was Completed Today

### 🔄 1. Reset Auction API

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Status |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| `/api/auction/reset` | `POST` | Resets all players to `UNSOLD`, nullifies team, and clears `AuctionState` | ✅ |

---

### 💡 Logic Highlights

- Reset logic iterates over all players:
    - `status → UNSOLD`
    - `team → null`
- Used `saveAll()` for batch update efficiency
- Cleared `AuctionState.currentPlayerId = null` to clean the in-memory auction tracker
- Skipped update for players who were already `UNSOLD` (optimization)

---

### 🧠 Git & Code Workflow

- Verified local vs remote sync using:
    - `git fetch`
    - `git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline`
- Resolved push conflicts using:
    - `git pull --rebase origin main`
- Confirmed that correct folder (`ipl_bidding`) is now tracked & pushed to GitHub

## 🔍 Sample Logic for `resetAuction()`

```java
List<Player> players = player_repo.findAll();
for (Player p : players) {
    if (p.getStatus() != AuctionStatus.UNSOLD) {
        p.setStatus(AuctionStatus.UNSOLD);
        p.setTeam(null);
    }
}
player_repo.saveAll(players);
auctionState.setCurrentPlayerId(null);
